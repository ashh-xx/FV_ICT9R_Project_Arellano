				<p>Fire can pose a threat to one's safety if it gets out of hand. Not only that, but it can also cause destruction to one's belongings and property. However, there are the unfortunate times where we are unable to prevent these accidents from happening. Even in such cases, you must be prepared and know what to do so that it won't lead to more catastrophic disasters or casualties.</p>
				<h3>Stay Calm</h3>
				<p>In any disaster, stay calm. Panicking will cause you to act impulsively which can lead you to harming yourself and others around you trying to escape the mishap. There are things that you need to remember when trying to get out of a burning house, staying calm will help you think more clearly and remember these things better.</p> 
				<h3>When Escaping</h3>
				<p>When a fire breaks out inside an indoor place where you are in, it is natural for you to attempt to get outside of that area. However, there are situations that need critical thinking for you to successfully escape.</p>
				<p>Use an escape route set for these types of emergencies. If the smoke is getting too thick, get down and crawl. If you are blocked of an exit, stay in one room with the door closed and with a wet towel or cloth under it.</p>
				<h3>Call For Help</h3>
				<p>Initially, you should have already done this at the first signs of a fire. You must take note of the National Emergency Hotline and Fire Protection Hotline for your area. <a href="">Click here</a> to view an article on emergency hotlines for when a fire breaks out.</p>
				<h3>Let Someone Know You're There</h3>
				<p>If you're trapped in a room with fire around it, you must let someone know you're there. If the window is not warm to the touch, open it and start yelling "fire!" while flashing a flashlight or bright object like a reflector. Never touch anything that is warm when your place is on fire.</p>
				<h3>After Escaping</h3>
				<p>If you've successfully escaped the burning complex, continue to call for help if nobody has arrived. Meet up with the other individuals in a planned space where you can recover.</p>
				<h3>Don't Be A Bystander</h3>
				<p>If you happen to witness a building with a bigger-than-average fire burning or if you hear someone yelling from inside, don't ignore it and immediately call for help. If you can, gather people to start putting out the fire with what they have like pails or hoses while waiting for the fire department to arrive.</p>
