				<p>Fire can pose a threat to one's safety if it gets out of hand. Not only that, but it can also cause destruction to one's belongings and property. It is important for us to know how to prevent these accidents from happening, especially taking note of the fact that there are many things that may ignite an uncontrollable fire. In this list, we will be covering ways on how to prevent the start of a fire in your home, office, or any other area you might be at.</p>
				<h3>1. Pay extra attention to your kitchen.</h3>
				<p>Kitchens are the most prone to fire accidents than any other part of the house as this specific area contains gas, appliances (mostly heat-related), and other flammable objects.</p> 
				<p>Always watch what you're cooking, never leave cloth materials like towels, oven mitts, and other items near an open stove, make sure to turn the gas tank off after using, and always make sure your appliances are properly functioning without any defects.</p>
				<p>While there are many more ways to be cautious around the kitchen, these are the most common that people need to take note of.</p>
				<h3>2. Unplug any wires that aren't being used.</h3>
				<p>You can always plug your wires back in when you will use them. Not only can this cause a fire, but it can also increase your electricity bill, charging you for unnecessary use of power.</p>
				<p>It also wouldn't hurt unplugging some daily used appliances like your Wi-Fi modem or Television. You may unplug these when you go to bed or leave the house as a safety precaution.</p>
				<h3>3. Store flammable objects away from possible fire sources.</h3>
				<p>Hairspray, cleaning products like dish soap, and other items in your house may be flammable. If so, these must be kept away from places where a fire can commonly start like near sockets or near kitchen stoves/appliances.</p>
				<h3>4. Own Fire Preventive/Alertive Equipment</h3>
				<p>Sometimes fires are inevitable, even if it's just a small one, but when small fires are left out too long, it may begin to spread. The best items to own for these instances are smoke detectors, sprinklers, and a fire extinguisher.</p>
				<h3>5. Don't play with fire!</h3>
				<p>This is common sense. Do not play with fire or things that may cause a fire like matches, lighters and blow torches.</p>
				<p>This is a thing to be mindful of not just indoors but outdoors as well. An outdoor fire is just as big of a threat than an indoor fire, maybe even worse. Outdoor fires are not enclosed by walls and can catch on quickly to leaves and wood barks which can spread in a larger perimeter, posing a threat to other living beings and fellow humans other than yourself.</p>
